					<description><![CDATA[<p>Even before Covid, there was a trend to distributed software development and software testing teams. In this article, we are going to list some tools that can be useful for distributed software testing teams. Author: Franco Martinig There are multiple existing sources about tools for distributed software development teams or remote working. In this article, we will focus on free or inexpensive tools that are available to small distributed software testing teams that operate outside a major organizational framework. We do not discuss the tools needed for testing which depend on the target to be tested (mobile app, website, API), but rather the tools that distributed software testers will use to communicate or plan and perform the test activities. You could naturally rent your own space on the web and install some open-source tools, but we will limit the scope to tools that teams can quickly use without having to spend a lot of time and efforts for installation and configuration. Team communication  Besides the traditional email communication, distributed software testing teams can also need to use other tools for real-time messaging, chat, or video conferencing. For instant messaging or continuous conversations, Discord, Slack, Rocket Chat, Mattermost, Bitrix24 or Chanty are the best know tools that are available for free. If all team members use Gmail, Google Chat and Google Meet can also be options. Microsoft Teams has also a free option with limited features that can be used by small teams for chat, videoconferencing and document sharing.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>LambdaTest has announced a partnership integration with Katalon quality management platform, to enable seamless experiences for enterprises &#8211; from writing test scripts to test execution and reporting. Software developers and testers typically switch between multiple platforms to write test scripts and execute them, leading to constant friction and interruptions, and ultimately resulting in delayed time to market and bad customer experiences. With LamdaTest integrating with Katalon, users can write test scripts in Katalon Studio, an automation solution for web, API, mobile, and desktop applications testing, and then run tests on the LambdaTest’s HyperExecute Selenium Grid directly from their Katalon Studio instance without having to shift between multiple platforms. HyperExecute is LambdaTest’s test orchestration platform. LambdaTest recently raised $45 million in a venture round led by Premji Invest with participation from existing investors.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The world of automated testing is booming. With a worldwide market of 20.70 billion euros in 2021¹ and an estimated annualized growth of 19% by 2030¹, the deployment of automated tests is becoming part of the top priorities to help companies accelerate their transformation. Author: Antoine Craske The significant contributions of test automation reported in the World Quality Report 2022-23² are to contribute to the implementation of a CI/CD approach (55%²) and the improvement of the value of tests while reducing their number (53%²). The best value of automated tests is captured through the implementation of functional tests (46%²) and integration tests (45%²). These test typologies are precisely those supported by Cerberus Testing, the 100% open-source test automation platform. The new Cerberus Testing 4.15 release offers a series of new features and improvements to allow as many people as possible to accelerate with quality by improving the accessibility and ease of setting up automated tests of modern software engineering teams. More intuitive user journeys The philosophy of Cerberus Testing is to facilitate cross-functional collaboration on automated tests around a shared interface. Usability, intuitivity, and onboarding have been a major focus of this new version, especially for easing the adoption for new users of the platform. The vision of the experience is that of an “Amazon 1-click” allowing to “create, execute, visualize an automated test in less than 30 seconds” for any user, whether or not they are familiar with the solution, removing any friction on automation journeys.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>As soon as your application is linked to a network, it will become the target of cyberattacks by hackers. This article explains how to mitigate the effects of cyberattacks and how to prevent them with security testing practices. Author: Nataliia Syvynska, TestMatick, https://testmatick.com/ According to recent sociological studies, in the past 2021, the price of damage from global cyberattacks was about $15 trillion. Simply put, every 11 seconds, various ransomware attacks web businesses. The cumulative number of attacks worldwide is increasing by 15% annually. Cybercriminals mostly look to financial and banking digital wallets, Decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, smart contracts, and cyber theft of personal data. Few Words about Cyberattacks and How They Are Carried Out  In short, a cyberattack is the manipulation of digital systems that aims at malicious action. Usually, it starts with the hacker hiding his physical IP address. As a rule, all sorts of proxies and VPN programs are used for this purpose. Then a virtual machine is used instead of a real PC. Hackers use software that can emulate the work of a desktop computer. The virtual software is easy to change, and even on one physical device, you can run up to 10 simultaneously working machines. Also, it is possible to use a real PC to which you can connect remotely. A hacker who can control a third-party PC not only hides but can also easily compromise a potential victim (for example, by hacking a personal account in social networks or by transferring funds without permission).

					<description><![CDATA[<p>This presentation is about the common mistakes that people make when writing tests. It highlights more aspects like bloated tests which make it hard to figure out what they are about and proper usage of assertions to get better error messages. Especially if you don&#8217;t work with Test-Driven Development (TDD), it can be easy to come up with a test that looks good but stands in your way when it fails. The talk explores four scenarios that are outlined above, explain why it makes sense to think about them and actionable suggestions how to improve tests.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Model-based testing is a software testing approach that is based on models of the system under test and its environment to define, manually or automatically, the test cases. The models explicitly represent the intended behavior of a system and its environment. The use of explicit models is aimed to avoid the problems caused by a traditional process of defining tests cases that tends to be unstructured, lacking explicit motivations, not reproducible, not documented, and largely influenced by the level of skills of software testers. Model-based testing tools allow defining the model of the system and provide an automatic generation of the test cases derived from this model. This article lists the main open source model-based testing tools available and recently maintained today. Use our contact form to make us aware of some open source test automation tools for model-based testing that we should add to this list. Fastbot Fastbot is an open source model-based testing tool for modeling GUI transitions to discover app stability problems in Android and iOS applications. The model is build via graph transition with the consideration of high reward choice selection. Fastbot combines machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to assist discovery in a more intelligent way. Fastbot is compatible with multiple Android OS systems, including original Android, Android 5-12 and a variation of modified Android-based system by domestic manufacturers. Inherited from original Monkey, Fastbot allows for fast action insertion as high as 12 actions per second.

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Throw a line of code into many codebases and it is sure to hit one or more testing frameworks. There is no shortage of frameworks for testing, each with their particular spin and set of conventions, but that glut is not always matched by a clear vision of how to structure and use tests cases. A testing framework is a vehicle, but you still need to know how to drive. The computer science classic, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, points out that &#8220;programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute&#8221;. The same is true of test code. This presentation takes a deep dive into unit testing, looking at examples and counterexamples across a range of languages and frameworks, from naming to nesting, exploring the benefits of data-driven testing, the trade-offs between example-based and property-based testing, how to get the most out of the common given-when-then refrain and knowing how far to follow it.
