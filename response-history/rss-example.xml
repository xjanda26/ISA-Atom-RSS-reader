<title>19.9-16.12.2022 Lecture groups BIA and BIB for winter semester of 2022/2023 academic year</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/study-news/h19068/</link>
<description>The recommended (approximate) division into the lecture groups is as follows:&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;&lt;LI&gt;1BIT students with surname beginning with &lt;B&gt;A to N&lt;/B&gt; are in the &lt;B&gt;1BIA group&lt;/B&gt;,
&lt;LI&gt;1BIT students with surname beginning with &lt;B&gt;O to Ž&lt;/B&gt; are in the &lt;B&gt;1BIB group&lt;/B&gt;,
&lt;LI&gt;for students in &lt;B&gt;2BIT&lt;/B&gt;, the groups are recommended based on the summer semester of the 2021/2022 academic year (alphabetically, the middle is approximately between L and M).
&lt;/UL&gt;
If there is room in the lecture rooms, the &lt;B&gt;membership in the groups is not going to be checked&lt;/B&gt;. When the capacity of the lecture room is reached, students that have the second group in schedule collision and then students that are members of the particular group have priority.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The mid-semester exams are going to be organized separately in the individual courses. You &lt;B&gt;don't have to report&lt;/B&gt; the change of the lecture group due to the schedule collision - just go to the activity that does not have the collision.</description>

<title>15.9-30.11.2022 1BIT: Placement test of knowledge/skills in English</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/study-news/h19298/</link>
<description>The condition for completing the bachelor's study programme is to fulfillment of the compulsory course &quot;English&quot; at the level of at least B1 (&lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/BAN4/&quot;&gt;BAN4&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/BPC-PA1/&quot;&gt;BPC-PA1&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/GEN/&quot;&gt;GEN&lt;/A&gt; or &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/ZAN4/&quot;&gt;ZAN4&lt;/A&gt;) or higher (&lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/AIT/&quot;&gt;AIT&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/0AX/&quot;&gt;0AX&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/0A9/&quot;&gt;0A9&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/BPC-PA2/&quot;&gt;BPC-PA2&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/BPC-PA3/&quot;&gt;BPC-PA3&lt;/A&gt; or &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/BPC-PA4/&quot;&gt;BPC-PA4&lt;/A&gt;).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;B&gt;For 1BIT students, a &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.vut.cz/studis/student.phtml?sn=jazyk_rtest&quot;&gt;placement test&lt;/A&gt; in English is prepared in the BUT IS&lt;/B&gt;, on the basis of which they will have the opportunity to register:
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;immediately in the winter semester course &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/GEN/&quot;&gt;GEN&lt;/A&gt; or &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/ZAN4/&quot;&gt;ZAN4&lt;/A&gt; (with a score of 51 or more points)&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;in the summer semester, a subject corresponding to the level achieved in the test (courses not yet named will also be offered &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/BAN1/&quot;&gt;BAN1&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/BAN2/&quot;&gt;BAN2&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/BAN3/&quot;&gt;BAN3&lt;/A&gt;)&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The registration will take place in such a way that everyone who enters the test can register in January in a course with a level according to proven knowledge. Who does not register for an English course will have the opportunity to register it only in the 3rd semester of study. Details will be specified in a separate news in January 2023.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;B&gt;The test&lt;/B&gt; will &lt;B&gt;open&lt;/B&gt; on Thursday &lt;B&gt;15 September 2022&lt;/B&gt; at &lt;B&gt;8 p.m.&lt;/B&gt; and close on &lt;B&gt;30 November 2022&lt;/B&gt;. It is strongly recommended to write the test honestly, because trying to improve the results above your actual level can lead to problems with completing a course. Also, do not underestimate the test and do not send an empty or unfinished test unnecessarily. Otherwise, there is a risk that you will be assigned a level that is too low, which would be a waste of time for you. &lt;B&gt;Those who do not take the test will not be able to start studying English from this summer semester.&lt;/B&gt; There are a maximum of 3 attempts to complete the test within the time limit. &lt;B&gt;Repetition of the test, obtaining further attempts&lt;/B&gt; to complete the test &lt;B&gt;or passing after the due date is excluded&lt;/B&gt; (any questions and requests are unnecessary). &lt;B&gt;Compared to the achieved result, it is possible to change by a maximum of 1 level, based on the application submitted no later than two weeks after the end of the test.&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Holders of certificates of general state or international examination in English - &lt;B&gt;State General English Language Examination&lt;/B&gt;, First Certificate in English (&lt;B&gt;FCE&lt;/B&gt;), Certificate of Advanced English (&lt;B&gt;CAE&lt;/B&gt;), Certificate of Proficiency in English (&lt;B&gt;CPE&lt;/B&gt;), International English Language Testing System (&lt;B&gt;IELTS&lt;/B&gt;), Test of English as a Foreign Language (&lt;B&gt;TOEFL&lt;/B&gt;), or another certificate of the appropriate level, proceeds according to the &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.fit.vutbr.cz/study/advisor/aktualni_vyhlasky/jazyky-na-FEKT.php&quot;&gt;Decree of FEEC&lt;/A&gt;. Consult the recognition by e-mail with the study advisor of UJAZ FEKT for FIT &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.vut.cz/en/people/alena-baumgartnerova-1972&quot;&gt;PaedDr. Baumgartnerová&lt;/A&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;B&gt;WHO DOES NOT APPLY FOR RECOGNITION OF THE CERTIFICATE and enroll in some English course can no longer apply for recognition&lt;/B&gt;.</description>

<title>12.9.2022 FIT researchers work on preventing laser dazzling of pilots by developing a security system that finds the attacker</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3396/</link>
<description>The pilot is preparing for landing on the runway when a&amp;nbsp;blinding green beam illuminates the entire cockpit. It was just hit from the ground by an attacker using lasers. Each year, the police register several dangerous incidents that could potentially result in a&amp;nbsp;tragedy. Therefore, the Václav Havel Airport in cooperation with the Czech Police reached out to researchers from the FIT BUT, CTU and the University of Defence. The goal is to design a&amp;nbsp;system of aerial protection against low-power lasers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/3395/.en&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

<title>1.9.2022 - 11.6.2023 Physical education at BUT</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/study-news/h19070/</link>
<description>The aim of the work of CESA BUT is a quality physical education process and equal access of all students to physical education and sports activities. CESA's work is based on the philosophy of a healthy lifestyle and an active way of life for university students, including the presentation and promotion of health-promoting physical activities.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The course &lt;B&gt;Physical education&lt;/B&gt; is optional and can be attended by students in the bachelor's and master's study and is also made available to students from doctoral programs. Semester teaching of the optional subject of physical education takes place together for all students of all faculties, regardless of grade. In the educational programs of individual sports, groups of students are created according to performance from beginners to performance athletes and representative selections of BUT. Health-oriented physical activities (physiogram, group exercises, fitness strengthening, fitness training, massages and regeneration, etc.) have an irreplaceable place in the physical educational program. The course ends with &lt;B&gt;accreditation and credit&lt;/B&gt;.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Enrollment in Physical education takes place in electronic form in the IS, always at the beginning of winter and summer semester and is specified at &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.cesa.vutbr.cz/studenti/plany&quot;&gt;https://www.cesa.vutbr.cz/studenti/plany&lt;/A&gt;. To register, you need to log in to Studis and get on time provide login details. You can try logging in at &lt;A href=&quot;https://vutbr.cz/studis&quot;&gt;https://vutbr.cz/studis&lt;/A&gt;. Students are entitled to &lt;B&gt;2.0 hours (2 enrollments) in each semester for free&lt;/B&gt;. Schedules are 2 weeks before the beginning of the semester to view in the IS or at &lt;A href=&quot;https://www.cesa.vutbr.cz/studenti/sporty&quot;&gt;https://www.cesa.vutbr.cz/studenti/sporty&lt;/A&gt;.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
From the point of view of the faculty, the Physical education is a &lt;B&gt;common elective course&lt;/B&gt;.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;

<title>8.6.2022 BUT sensors protect bee colonies from starvation and theft</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3324/</link>
<description>&lt;p align=left&gt;Do you like honey? And do you know  
what it takes to get it on your table? The bees must survive the winter, start  
collecting nectar in the spring and not freeze to death. But even warm weather  
and a strong bee colony are no guarantees that the beekeeper will be able to  
extract the honey. The bees can swarm and fly away, starve, or be stolen with  
the beehive. But there is a way to prevent all that: ApiVčelař 4.0 and the  
smart scales and sensors invented by BUT experts that remotely provide data to  
beekeepers. For more information &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/3323/.en&quot;&gt;see the article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</description>

personalities from the world of science and technology and seven distinguished  
international partners, including FIT Dean Pavel Zemčík. &amp;quot;These are  
personalities who have been our partners for many years. We would like to thank  
them for our successful co-operation and strengthen our future strategic  
partnerships,&amp;quot; said LUT Vice-Rector Jaana Sandström.&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p align=left&gt;Pavel  
Zemčík established co-operation with the Finnish university more than  
twenty-five years ago, beginning with three research and teaching fellowships  
he completed in Lappeenranta between 1996 and 1999. Gradually, the co-operation  
between FIT BUT and LUT began to deepen and today they are important partners  
in research, education and exchange programmes for students and academics.&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p align=left&gt;&amp;quot;The  
honorary doctorate is an award that I appreciate very much. LUT is a leading  
university and I am glad that I stood at the beginning of our partnership,  
watching as it has grown to become very strong today. I accept this as an  
appreciation of the co-operation between our faculty and our Finnish partners. When  
I look at the results that have come out of our collaborative efforts, I am  
convinced that joint work on research projects and study programmes will bring  
many more benefits to both parties in the future,&amp;quot; said Pavel Zemčík.&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p align=left&gt;The  
two universities share a research interest, particularly in the field of image  
processing. Researchers from both institutions have been involved in projects  
such as multispectral image processing, quality monitoring in wood production  
and plankton assessment. LUT and BUT even have a joint Master's double degree  
programme in Computer Vision and are currently preparing a joint PhD programme.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>12.5.2022 Czech and world cybersecurity experts to come to Brno</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3306/</link>
<description>&lt;b&gt;Current challenges and new results of cyber security research will form the programme of the European Conference on Security Research in Cyberspace. In addition to topics&amp;nbsp;such as cybercrime, safe artificial intelligence, protection of critical infrastructures of the state and education, and prevention in cyber security, it will offer a practical demonstration of the latest laboratory equipment. Held on the occasion of the Czech Presidency of the EU by Masaryk University, the Technical University in Brno and the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic, the international conference will take place from 12 to 14 September 2022.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Cybersecurity is a complex phenomenon that requires close cooperation between security forces and top research universities at state level,&amp;quot; explained Radim Polčák, Masaryk University's Vice-Rector for Development, Legislation and Information Technology. &amp;quot;Our university has been at the forefront of the Czech cyber security system, and the results of our research in various fields of informatics, law, social sciences and humanities still contribute to keeping us at the forefront of this field in Europe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three days, the conference&amp;nbsp;will bring together scientists and representatives of security forces, such as the Czech Police and the Security Information Service, and other state institutions and commercial companies. The conference will focus on topics such as secure artificial intelligence, modern cryptography, the creation of an international quantum network and image processing. It will also discuss cybersecurity education, speech and cybercrime mining, and network forensic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bart Preneel, a professor at the prestigious University of Leuven, Belgium, and the head of the renowned research group COSIC, will be the&amp;nbsp;keynote speaker at the conference. Professor Preneel has long been involved in information security, cryptography and privacy. In the past, he also served as president of the International Association for Cryptological Research. He is the author of more than 400 scientific publications and 5 patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[img]&quot; src=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news-file/3306/kyber_1600.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another main topic will be&amp;nbsp;education and prevention in cybersecurity. This will include discussion of cyber arenas for skills training, awareness-raising in the field of quantum threats, and vocational training. Delegates will have the opportunity to visit modern laboratories recently opened to researchers at BUT. &amp;quot;With the advent of new technologies and the current international situation, we cannot expect a decrease in the number of cyber-attacks,&amp;quot; said Jan Hajný, a leading expert on cryptography and cyber security at the Brno University of Technology. &amp;quot;On the contrary, we need to prepare for more frequent and complex attacks, which may have stronger effects on our daily lives and the running of the state. It is therefore important that we not only talk about the future of technology and cyber security, but that we are adequately prepared for such scenarios. This will also be one of the topics of the Brno conference.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conference will also present the concept behind the National Research and Development Plan in the field of cybersecurity, as well as focusing on new opportunities to support cybersecurity research, both at national (Czech) and European level, especially in terms of technological trends, application of results in practice (opportunities and limits in transmitting results) and tools to support security programmes at national level. &amp;quot;Within the framework of the Czech presidency of the Council of the European Union, the conference provides a unique opportunity to present cyber security research as a key part of the security research system in the Czech Republic,&amp;quot; said Petr Novák, director of the Department of Security Research and Police Education of the Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-day event will take place at several faculties of Masaryk University and the Brno University of Technology. The conference is held under the auspices of the city of Brno. Detailed information, including the registration form, is available at&amp;nbsp;www.eu-secres.eu.&amp;nbsp;Registration for the conference is mandatory, but there is no registration fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The event is organized within the framework of the Czech presidency of the Council of the EU and is financed from projects VJ01030001, VJ01030002, VJ01030004 and VJ01030007 of the Ministry of the Interior Strategic Support for Security Research Development 2019-2025 (IMPAKT 1).&lt;/i&gt;</description>

<title>10.5.2022 Professional workshops, self-driving cars and concerts - the Faculty celebrates its anniversary at the FIT Festival</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3309/</link>
<description>&lt;p align=left&gt;&lt;b&gt;Professional workshops, self-driving   
cars, concerts and a bouncy castle - the Faculty celebrates its anniversary at   
the FIT Festival&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p align=left&gt;The   
last Saturday of April saw the celebration of the 20th anniversary   
of the founding of the Faculty of Information Technology. The Faculty campus   
welcomed over 1,100 visitors. Beautiful sunny weather and a rich programme gave   
everyone a nice opportunity for meeting other people and enjoying the festival   
day.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p align=left&gt;The   
morning and early afternoon belonged to science and research: 24 IT workshops   
and the Excel@FIT student conference were held, where 33 projects were assessed   
this year. The visitors toured the laboratories and were inspired by Leoš   
Dvořák's lecture titled &amp;quot;Software Quo Vadis&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p align=left&gt;The   
courtyard at Building L was besieged by children playing on the bouncy castle,   
taking part in competitions and cheering on rabbits as they hopped over the   
obstacles. In the FabLab truck, they could 3D print a whistle and take a look   
at the technical gadgets on display.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p align=left&gt;The   
Students' Union organised many games and sports competitions and the results   
were impressive. For example, several participants in the roaring competition   
broke the 120-decibel threshold, which corresponds to the loudness of an   
average pneumatic drill.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p align=left&gt;In the   
afternoon, student bands from FIT followed by Michal Horák and Petr Čadek took   
the main stage, producing a great musical experience from the first song to the   
last.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p align=left&gt;The   
Faculty thanks all visitors for finding their way to our event, our partners   
for their support and everyone who participated in the preparation of the   
festival. It was a great success. Take a look at our &lt;a href=&quot;https://festivalfit.cz/akce&quot;&gt;photo gallery&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GD02BKZ4w3E&quot;&gt;watch the   
video&lt;/a&gt; that will take you through the festival day.</description>

<title>3.2.2022 The Minister of Education and the Mayor of Brno congratulated FIT on its 20th anniversary at a gala evening</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3264/</link>
<description>&lt;p align=left&gt;&lt;b&gt;On Wednesday evening, the Faculty of Information Technology celebrated the 20th anniversary of its foundation on 1&amp;nbsp;January. At the gala evening organised in the Brno City Theatre, the Dean of FIT Pavel Zemčík presented the FIT gold and silver medals. The Faculty was also congratulated on its anniversary by the Minister of Education Petr Gazdík, the Mayor of Brno Markéta Vaňková and the new Rector of BUT Ladislav Janíček.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=left&gt;The 1st of January 2022 marked twenty years since the establishment of the BUT Faculty of Information Technology. The anniversary was celebrated at a gala evening attended by staff, students and invited guests. &amp;quot;At the very beginning, there was an effort to give room to a dynamically developing field, which was then beginning to have a growing social impact. In twenty years, the Faculty has become an integral part of education and research in the Czech Republic and I am happy that we have made a name for ourselves in Europe and the world. FIT has grown considerably in that time and I am glad that we have managed to preserve the values with which we founded it,&amp;quot; said Pavel Zemčík, Dean of the BUT Faculty of Information Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=left&gt;Over the past 20 years, information technology has become one of the driving engines of Brno's economy. &amp;quot;And the Faculty of Information Technology has also played a part in this. It cultivates cutting-edge research and knowledge it can pass on to students. This is extremely important for the whole of society,&amp;quot; said Minister of Education Petr Gazdík.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=left&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[img]&quot; src=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news-file/3264/fit3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Minister of Education, Youth and Sports Petr Gazdík.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=left&gt;Markéta Vaňková, the Mayor of Brno, also congratulated the Faculty on its 20th anniversary at the gala evening. &amp;quot;The Faculty has helped to change Brno since its founding. Also thanks to FIT, South Moravia is turning into a knowledge-economy region. By building its unique campus, it has helped to change and beautify the face of Královo Pole,&amp;quot; said Markéta Vaňková.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=left&gt;Ladislav Janíček attended the ceremony as the first official event in his new role as Rector of BUT. &amp;quot;The Faculty not only educates top engineering graduates, but it is one of the most efficient at BUT in terms of obtaining international research grants, as well as national funding. It performs very well in contract research and collaboration with the industry, including knowledge transfer and the establishment of spin-off and start-up companies. I wish the Faculty many excellent applicants, students, employees and graduates in the decades to come and at least equally successful and even better results in research, including in collaboration with the industry,&amp;quot; said Rector of BUT Ladislav Janíček.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=left&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[img]&quot; src=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news-file/3264/fit2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Faculty was also congratulated on its anniversary by the Mayor of Brno Markéta Vaňková and the Rector of BUT Ladislav Janíček.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=left&gt;The Dean of FIT presented gold and silver medals at the ceremony.

<title>4.1.2022 An app developed by a FIT student helps create a perfect diet</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3253/</link>
<description>Kilojoules 
and protein intake, eating chicken with rice instead of burger with fries - do 
you think that only bodybuilders worry about their diet? That's not the case at 
all! Everyone should be interested in nutrition, whether they want to lose 
weight, build muscles, or just maintain the same weight they had when they were 
twenty (if advisable). It should now be easier than ever to create the perfect 
diet thanks to an app developed by a computer science student from Brno 
University of Technology. Lovers of sweets or the aforementioned burger will 
also find something to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/3246/.en&quot;&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</description>

<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3233/</link>
<description>Being with people who give you their undivided attention. For the 
average person, this is basically an everyday situation. For people suffering 
from social phobia, this is a very stressful moment. Thanks to the Ekhi project 
which is being worked on by physicians from the University Hospital Brno and 
experts from the Masaryk University in Brno in co-operation with the team led 
by Tomáš Švec from the Faculty of Information Technology of the Brno University 
of Technology, patients suffering from various mental disorders will soon be 
able to train various situations or revisit stressful experiences in the safety 
of virtual reality. They will be accompanied by a therapist who will be able to 
control the situation and adjust the patients' stress level. For more information, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/3229/.en&quot;&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</description>

<title>8.12.2021 From a start-up of academic staff to a global leader: Phonexia becomes the company of the year</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3235/</link>
<description>Phonexia won the company 
of the year 2021. The company was founded fifteen years ago as a &amp;quot;speech 
research&amp;quot; group at FIT with which it has been very closely co-operating up to 
these days. Phonexia is a global leader in its field&amp;nbsp;- a unique technology 
which, as the first one in the world, is able to identify a speaker solely 
using a neural network to achieve the highest accuracy and speed possible. The 
company owes its global success to long-term top-quality work by researchers 
and scientist in the field of voice technology. For further information,

<title>6.12.2021 Printed violoncellos are played by a philharmonic concertmaster or a hockey player</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3234/</link>
<description>Did you know that when a violoncello player travels with the instrument, 
they must buy the instrument its own flight ticket? That gets expensive and not 
even an extra fee may be enough to alleviate the fear of an instrument which is 
sometimes worth hundreds of thousands of Czech crowns getting damaged. Last 
spring, a new product arrived to the Czech market which can easily fit in a 
violin case. Many fans of classical music would think it too bold and perhaps 
doomed to failure, but the 3D printed violoncello made by a BUT graduate raised 
over a million Czech crowns in a public fundraiser campaign and also made an 
appearance at the stage of Brno Philharmonic. For more information, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/3221/.en&quot;&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</description>

<title>2.11.2021 Revolution in hearing devices? Kateřina Žmolíková succeeded in the international Clarity Challenge</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3191/</link>
<description>How could machine 
learning help people with a hearing impairment? It is one of the challenges in 
the field of automatic speech recognition&amp;nbsp;- even the most sophisticated 
existing hearing aids still face difficulties perceiving speech-in-noise. The 
Clarity Challenge focused on the next generation of hearing aids which could 
use machine learning. Kateřina Žmolíková, a member of BUT Speech@FIT, a &amp;quot;speech 
research&amp;quot; group, won the first place in the MBSTOI evaluation category and also 
was awarded an Amazon student prize (first place). Have a look at her

<title>7.10.2021 A new company with BUT ownership interest was founded at FIT. It focuses on FPGA and ASIC technologies.</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3175/</link>
<description>A new company with BUT  
ownership interest was founded at the Faculty of Information Technology. The  
founders of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brnologic.cz/index_en.html&quot;&gt;BrnoLogic&lt;/a&gt;, which is to be based at FIT, are researchers of the  
Accelerated Network Technologies research group. The company will focus on the development  
of FPGA and ASIC chips and thus help other companies develop new products and  
applications that require the use of this technology to accelerate data  
processing, reduce latency, power consumption, or other hard-to-reach  
parameters.   
  
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We would like to  
support the ecosystem of companies based in the South Moravian Region and  
elsewhere in designing and verifying systems especially for FPGA and ASIC  
technologies. We build on 15 years of experience with designing various systems  
necessitating HW acceleration and want to pass on such experience to companies  
which do not have relevant capacity or knowledge to focus on this field. We  
also would like to apply a range of IP blocks we designed within various  
research activities,&amp;quot; says Jan Kořenek, Associate Professor at FIT and one of  
the founders of BrnoLogic. The researchers would like to reflect the experience  
gained from the co-operation and designing of various applications to their  
teaching and work with their students.</description>

<title>7.10.2021 FIT student wants to make life easier for drivers. She came up with a way to find parking spaces using radar</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3174/</link>
<description>Everybody who has ever been to Brno by car during a working week 
probably knows that finding a parking space is about as likely as winning a 
lottery. This is especially true if the driver must rely on parking spaces 
available to everybody and not just to residents. In the future, drivers could 
be spared having to cruise around hoping somebody decides to leave in part 
thanks to a technology developed by a FIT BUT student, Kateřina Rafajová. She 
utilised both radars and GPS mounted in cars to find free parking spaces in the 
area. For more information, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/3173/.en&quot;&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</description>

<title>30.9.2021 A new method developed by FIT researchers will contribute to more realistic videogame and virtual reality environments</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3165/</link>
<description>A new method developed 
by researchers from the CPhoto@FIT group can measure the realism of 
synthetically generated trees. They described the underlying research together with 
their colleagues from the Purdue University in a paper which was accepted at 
SIGGRAPH&amp;nbsp;- the most prestigious conference on graphics, which will take 
place in Tokyo in December. &amp;quot;It is a huge success. We conducted an extensive 
user study in which 4,000 participants compared over one million pairs of 
images so that we know which images look the most realistic.&amp;nbsp; The scores were used to train our neural 
network, called ICTree. The program is now able to recognise which 
synthetically generated trees are likely or unlikely to be considered 
realistic,&amp;quot; describes Martin Čadík, one of the authors of the paper. The method 
can be used by developers of simulators, games, architectural visualisations or 
virtual reality applications, i.e. wherever synthetically generated 3D trees 
are used, to design a more realistic environment. More information and video 
available &lt;a href=&quot;http://cphoto.fit.vutbr.cz/ictree/&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

<title>10.9.2021 Sixty years ago, BUT entered the era of computers. A conference will commemorate this anniversary</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3143/</link>
<description>&lt;b&gt;Sixty years ago, the   
first computer was installed at the Brno University of Technology and a   
separate Laboratory of Computing Machines began to function fully. However, the   
beginnings of computer science at BUT were complex, so the first LGP-30   
computer and the new laboratory found their home at the Faculty of Mechanical   
Engineering.&lt;/b&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;The Laboratory of   
Computing Machines was established by a decision of the Rector at the   
Department of Mathematics of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in 1959,   
another source states the establishment of the laboratory as an independent   
department at the Faculty in 1961. But it is certain since when the workplace   
could be proud of its own computer, which was the first at BUT: in 1961, the   
ministry decided to purchase and install the LGP-30 computer.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It was a fairly small   
and unique computer at the time. And also very progressive. Many computers were   
rather experimental at the time, so they suffered from, so to speak, childhood   
diseases. On the contrary, LGP-30 was a commercially produced computer, which   
was not used for experiments, but for calculations,&amp;quot; remembers Branislav Lacko,   
who worked on the computer as a student and still works at BUT at the Institute   
of Automation and Computer Science, FME.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[img]&quot; src=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news-file/3143/lgp301.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;LGP-30 computer   
operation (photo: FIT BUT archives)&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;The LGP-30 computer was   
also unique for its time in that, as an American technology, it even got behind   
the Iron Curtain. It had been produced in the USA since 1956 and was available   
for purchase for $ 47,000, which would be almost half a million dollars in   
terms of prices in 2020. &amp;quot;At that time, large mainframe computers, mostly of   
Soviet production, were already installed in Czechoslovakia, but the university   
could not afford them. In addition, it was the beginning of the 1960s, the   
Prague Spring was slowly approaching, and a loosening began. Probably that's   
why it was possible to bring this computer here,&amp;quot; Lacko thinks. He himself   
planned the calculations for his diploma thesis, but the computational   
possibilities of the LGP-30 computer proved to be insufficient, so he finally   
completed the diploma on other, later installed machines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;In 1962, the LGP-30 computer   
was already in full operation, installed in a building in today's Údolní   
Street, the then Obránců míru. &amp;quot;The computer was firmly connected to an   
electric typewriter, which punched eight-foot punched tape, so it was used to   
enter data and instructions, i.e. to operate the computer. Other separate   
electric typewriters were in the so-called punch. Because not everyone could   
operate them, instructions were written on special forms and later the punch   
workers punched them into the punched tape,&amp;quot; recalls Lacko.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[img]&quot; src=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news-file/3143/fme.jpg&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt;Laboratory of   
Computer Machines (photo: publication &amp;quot;75 years of the Faculty of Mechanical   
Engineering, BUT&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;The laboratory of   
computing machines served as a computer centre not only for BUT, but also for   
other institutions or manufacturing companies. At the time, this workplace was   
the largest from all universities in Czechoslovakia in terms of facilities. In   
addition to providing computing time for research, it also began educating the   
first computer professionals. &amp;quot;From the beginning, computers were also used for   
teaching. However, at that time the subjects were not entirely common, but   
rather exceptionally offered. Usually, students showed up with a simple program   
punched in the tape to perform some calculation. At that time, there was no idea   
what to teach and whom,&amp;quot; adds Lacko.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;The first LGP-30   
computer was soon overshadowed by more powerful mainframe computers: in January   
1966, the Soviet MINSK 22 was installed at BUT, half a year later the Swedish   
DATASAAB D21 was added, and finally, in September 1972 the Czechoslovak TESLA   
200 computer came. In 1975, the laboratory had about 80 employees and computers   
were used for three shifts, often also on weekends. The LGP-30 computer later   
moved to the Department of Automatic Computers, which was founded in 1964 at   
the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, and where today's FIT has its roots. On   
the contrary, the CIS organizational unit was established in 1992 from the   
Laboratory of Computing Machines, which is still committed to the legacy of the   
Laboratory of Computing Machines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;The Technical Museum in   
Brno is preparing a professional conference on the topic on 22&amp;nbsp;September,   
details can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://prog-story.technicalmuseum.cz/images/novinky/tmb-2021-1.jpg&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>16.8.2021 A student of FIT came up with a smart water heater which can reduce costs by up to a third</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3133/</link>
<description>Turning a standard water heater into a smart one using an affordable 
device and reducing consumption by up to a third. That is what Adam Grünwald of 
the Faculty of Information Technology of BUT managed to do in his Bachelor's 
thesis. Furthermore, his invention can connect to the Google Calendar which for 
example allows the water heater to know when its owner is leaving for a 
vacation. Grünwald plans to further improve the device and even considers 
placing it on the market. For more information, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3129/.en&quot;&gt;read the article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</description>

<description>&lt;p align=left&gt;A traffic accident,    
an athlete's collapse or a&amp;nbsp;smoke bomb - all of these need to be addressed    
as soon as possible to prevent injury or further damage. However, it is sometimes    
not possible for human beings to identify exactly where the problem originated    
in the ensuing confusion and to direct rescuers to the right place. The new    
&amp;quot;anomaly detection system&amp;quot; was created by computer science students    
and offered to police officers, who could use it to quickly and automatically    
detect a&amp;nbsp;problem and put it on a&amp;nbsp;map. You can find more &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/3123/.en&quot;&gt;in the article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</description>

<title>22.7.2021 (F)IT Summer School for Girls will support female IT students for the fifteenth time</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3089/</link>
<description>&lt;b&gt;The Faculty of Information Technology of BUT will host fifteenth edition   
of the (F)IT Summer School for Girls. Its aim is to encourage girls to pursue   
education in IT. &amp;quot;Although the proportion of female students at our faculty is   
slowly increasing, the number is still far from ideal. This is also reflected   
in the representation of women in this field, with the Czech Republic still   
lagging behind most European countries in this respect. Since women are very   
successful in IT, it is a great shame that there are not more of them in this   
field,&amp;quot; says Pavel Zemčík, Dean of the Faculty.&lt;/b&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;This year's event, which will take place from 23 to 27 August, is aimed   
at female secondary school students. The five-day event will introduce them to   
different areas of information technology and the latest trends, but most   
importantly, they will have the opportunity to try everything out in practice.   
Participants can look forward to programming a video game, building a robot,   
creating a chat application, making a prototype using a 3D printer, seeing   
virtual reality demonstrations or working with biometrics.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are a technical university, but there is no reason why IT should be   
more difficult for women. Even our experience shows how successful women are in   
IT. The idea that IT is not for women still probably resonates in some parts of   
society, which is a great shame,&amp;quot; says Vítězslav Beran, Vice-Dean for External   
Relations. The Summer School would like to help break down this stereotype and   
show that IT is a diverse and creative field, in which you can do anything,   
provided you have a solid baseline. &amp;quot;Nowadays, information technology affects   
almost every aspect of our lives, therefore, it is important that both men and   
women are involved in designing new technologies. Women are truly welcome in   
IT, because they can bring fresh perspectives to problem solving and teamwork,&amp;quot;   
adds Šárka Květoňová, the head organiser of the event. &lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;More information and the programme of the event can be found on the   
&lt;a href=&quot;http://holky.fit.vutbr.cz/&quot;&gt;Summer School's website&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/events/313872720209613&quot;&gt;event page on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

<title>8.7.2021 Overloaded emergency lines? AI will help.</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3124/</link>
<description>Czech scientists,  
including researchers from the Faculty of Information Technology, are  
developing a voice bot which should be activated in case emergency lines become  
extremely overloaded. Voice bots should be able to increase capacities in case  
of a huge number of telephone calls to emergency control centres and thus may  
prove beneficial during serious natural disasters. The voice bot is developed  
by a team of 38 experts from various institutions: FIT BUT, IT4Innovations,  
Faculty of Safety Engineering, VSB-TUO and three companies&amp;nbsp;- Phonexia,  
BornDigital and SpeechTech which focus on text analysis and speech recognition  
and synthesis. The first prototype able to manage telephone calls regarding  
fire will be ready during the holidays. The project team will then work on its  
usability for other types of emergencies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/research/project/1306/.cs&quot;&gt;The project&lt;/a&gt; should be finished in the  
second half of 2022. More information to be found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.it4i.cz/o-it4i/infoservis/tiskove-zpravy/pretizene-tisnove-linky-s-resenim-pomuze-umela-inteligence&quot;&gt;the press release of the  
IT4Innovations National Supercomputing Centre&lt;/a&gt; which is a project coordinator  
together with VSB-TUO.</description>

<title>15.6.2021 Czechitas Thesis Award for Kristýna Zaklová of FIT</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3100/</link>
<description>Three best Bachelor's  
theses in the field of IT submitted between February 2020 and February 2021 won  
the Czechitas Thesis Award. The award for the best IT thesis written by a woman  
was presented to Kristýna Zaklová of FIT for her design and creation of a  
web-based search engine &amp;quot;Komu patřím&amp;quot; &lt;i&gt;(Who  
do I belong to)&lt;/i&gt; that allows users to search for records of registered pets.  
It can make the job easier especially for animal control, veterinarians, police  
and other people who need to identify a pet and its owner (we informed about it  
on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/2904/.en&quot;&gt;FIT website&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year). The committee evaluated the uniqueness  
of the idea, the quality of the thesis, its use in practice and evolution of  
the project based on mentoring which all participants underwent.</description>

<title>3.6.2021 The faculty received a new car from ŠKODA AUTO. It will serve the students in their studies</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3090/</link>
<description>For example, students will be able to try out user interface designs or  
experiment with on-board systems directly on a car available at the faculty.  
The partner company ŠKODA AUTO donated an Octavia IV. &amp;quot;It will now be used in  
specialised courses as well as in courses and seminars falling under the  
Cyberphysical Systems specialisation. Matěj Mitaš, a member of our team, who  
has unfortunately left us recently, deserves much of the credit for that, but  
also thanks to his efforts, the car will now be a part of teaching at the  
faculty,&amp;quot; said Peter Chudý. The Aeroworks research group, which he leads, has  
been co-operating with the automobile plant for a long time - together they  
have developed, for example, a unique system enabling the company's technical  
development staff to easily design various user interfaces (for more information,  
see the earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/2601/.en&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;).</description>

<title>2.6.2021 Bioinformatician helps archaeogeneticists search for primordial organisms</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3088/</link>
<description>Archaeogenetics. This is sometimes called ancestral reconstruction - a 
technique through which scientists investigate traces of the past, much like 
archaeologists. However, biologists do not look for them at excavation sites, 
but in computers. They are examining gene sequences and looking for organisms 
that no longer exist today. The new unique FireProt-ASR tool, developed by 
Miloš Musil from the Faculty of Information Technology of BUT, will 
fundamentally help researchers with finding millions-of-years-old proteins from 
which the current ones have evolved. You can find more information &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/3087/.en&quot;&gt;in the article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</description>

<title>21.5.2021 New app developed by FIT students helps people find barrier-free vaccination and testing sites</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3076/</link>
<description>&lt;b&gt;The new Covid without Barriers web application aims to facilitate vaccination and testing for persons with   
reduced mobility. The application is the brainchild of two FIT students - Josef   
Kolář and Peter Uhrín. The app, which was originally developed as a part of the   
WAP course, allows users to find wheelchair-accessible vaccination and testing   
sites on an interactive map. &lt;/b&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://covidbezbarier.cz/en&quot;&gt;Covid without Barriers&lt;/a&gt; is the only application that processes this   
information. &amp;quot;We need to give the vaccine to as many people as possible. There   
are a number of apps dealing with pandemic-related data, but when we were   
researching them, we noticed that none of them made it possible for us to   
directly display wheel-chair accessible sites,&amp;quot; says Josef Kolář, describing   
how the idea came about.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;The app, whose features and name the students discussed with the   
community of its potential users, accesses publicly available data through an   
API. The map shows wheelchair-accessible testing and vaccination sites at   
specific locations, and for each of these sites, a detail can be viewed that   
includes its address, services provided and references to detailed information   
in government-run applications. &amp;quot;It is also possible to search for sites based   
on the user's geographical location or address. The application also provides   
filters for individual site categories, so it is possible to display only   
vaccination or testing sites,&amp;quot; explains Peter Uhrín. &lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;According to him, the most challenging part was to create a simple and   
accessible user interface; it also took some time to test and optimise the app   
for mobile devices. The app is now fully deployed and is being used by dozens   
of people.</description>

<title>18.5.2021 The Technical Museum opens after nearly five months and will also exhibit three robots from FIT</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3081/</link>
<description>The Technical Museum in Brno re-opened its gates to visitors and  
unveiled the ROBOT2020 exhibition. It is the largest, most extensive and also the  
most expensive exhibition project in the museum's 60-year history, but the  
exhibition had to be closed in December, after just ten days of its opening,  
due to Covid-19 related restrictions. It is now re-opening with most of the  
exhibits. There is one hundred of them, including robots from FIT - &lt;a href=&quot;https://robot2020.cz/exponat/ruda-robot-pro-hledani-osob-v-lavinach/?trasa=veda-a-technika&quot;&gt;the RUDA  
rescue robot&lt;/a&gt;, an experimental workplace for research on effective ways of  
interaction between humans and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://robot2020.cz/exponat/artable/&quot;&gt;ARTABLE robot manipulator&lt;/a&gt;, and an exhibit by  
L&amp;amp;K Robotics - a start-up from FIT that produces semi-professional robots  
(for more information click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/2973/.en&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;). The exhibition will be open until 1 August.</description>

<title>13.5.2021 The successful Czech Science Foundation project reveals bugs in programs</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3072/</link>
<description>The efforts to minimise bugs in computer programs are a very hot topic.  
Bugs which are not found and corrected before deployment can cause great  
economic losses and even loss of life. The interest in automated bug-hunting  
techniques is therefore growing across industries, incentivising an intensive  
development of new bug hunting methods and tools. &amp;quot;Verification and bug hunting  
for advanced software&amp;quot; was also the topic of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/research/project/1080/.en&quot;&gt;ROBUST project&lt;/a&gt; led by Tomáš  
Vojnar from FIT and Jan Kofroň from the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of  
Charles University. The project was funded by the Czech Science Foundation, on  
whose website you can read a &lt;a href=&quot;https://gacr.cz/chyby-v-pocitacovych-programech-mohou-byt-zakerne-a-pritom-tezko-odhalitelne/&quot;&gt;recent article&lt;/a&gt; (in Czech) about the project. Researchers from  
FIT and MFF UK will pursue their research in this area further, among others  
within the follow-up project &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/research/project/1342/.en&quot;&gt;Snappy&lt;/a&gt;, also funded by the Czech Science  
Foundation.</description>

<title>7.5.2021 Students presented their best IT ideas at the Excel@FIT conference</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3069/</link>
<description>Over five dozen papers were presented in the final selection of the Excel@FIT student conference, which was held on Thursday by the Faculty of Information Technology of Brno University of Technology for the seventh time. FIT students presented their papers selected for the final round by a&amp;nbsp;committee of experts from both the academic and commercial sectors. The faculty distributed CZK 160,000 among the best contenders.&amp;nbsp;The conference traditionally seeks to showcase the best practical solutions developed by IT students. &amp;quot;It is a&amp;nbsp;space where students can present their work and inspire each other with their projects. They also have the opportunity to get feedback not only from academics but also from industry experts. We were pleasantly surprised by the interest in this year's competition, which had to be held online for the second time already, and especially the high quality of the papers presented,&amp;quot; said Milan Češka, Executive Chairman of the Excel@FIT Board.

<title>3.5.2021 Booster-Challenge@FIT awarded prizes to promising student start-up projects</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3065/</link>
<description>The Faculty of Information Technology expressed its support for the best   
business ideas which succeeded in the Booster-Challenge@FIT competition by   
awarding them with a total of 140 thousand Czech crowns. The committee, which   
evaluated the start-up projects mainly in terms of the uniqueness of the   
solution, business potential and social benefit, awarded prizes to three teams.   
The prize was awarded to four FIT students who created the Discyo app. Their   
app can give the user advice on what film to watch, what podcast to listen to   
or what videogame to play. The algorithm can recognise the user's preferences   
and what he or she might like across various media (this app has already   
succeeded in the BUT Student Entrepreneurial Spirit Award competition; you can   
read more about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/2960/.en&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;). The committee also awarded a prize to a project of   
the team led by Jan Polišenský, who works on a learning portal intended to   
prepare prospective students for the medical school entrance examination. The   
Medikem.cz server contains a huge database of test questions focusing on

<title>21.4.2021 Ph.D. students are preparing development of the CubeSat satellite at BUT</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3058/</link>
<description>The BUTCube team succeeded in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vutbr.cz/en/but/news-f19528/internal-grant-competition-d204934&quot;&gt;new BUT grant competition for Ph.D.  
students&lt;/a&gt; with its project dedicated to the development of a small space  
satellite. Over the next two years, the team will work on the development and  
design of a CubeSat satellite and its testing. &lt;a href=&quot;http://butcube.fme.vutbr.cz/en/index.html&quot;&gt;BUTCube&lt;/a&gt; is the first BUT team  
tasked with the creation of an entire CubeSat. They also plan to use the small  
satellite to test a number of innovative features - for example, 3D printing  
with thermoplastics. Members of the team also include Ph.D. students from the  
Department of Intelligent Systems - Štěpán Rydlo and Petr Malaník. They will be  
in charge of hardware development - solar panels, battery/power management and  
the control unit, as well as programming the satellite. However, other FIT  
students who would be interested in writing a Bachelor's or Master's thesis on  
this topic can also join the project. You can learn more about the BUTCube  
project in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://zvut.cz/tema/tema-f38144/houstone-mame-projekt-doktorandi-chystaji-prvni-vyvoj-cubesatu-na-vut-d210779&quot;&gt;zVUT.cz article &lt;/a&gt;(in Czech).</description>

<title>7.4.2021 FIT team wins first place in the MAPC - Multi-Agent Programming Contest</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3052/</link>
<description>A FIT BUT team won the fifteenth year of the most prestigious 
multi-agent programming competition, &lt;a href=&quot;https://multiagentcontest.org/2021/03/16/game-over.html&quot;&gt;MAPC 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Consisting of František Zbořil 
Jr., Václav Uhlíř as the main programmer and doctoral students František 
Vídeňský and Martin Šůstek, the team succeeded in global competition at the 
event, which compares different programming systems and approaches to the 
design of multi-agent systems. The team developed their own system, which succeeded 
in a series of challenges called Agents Assemble. &amp;quot;In this competition, the 
agents need to be quick, independent and have the social abilities to cooperate 
and resolve conflicts. We opted for a more reactive approach in which agents 
are not burdened by the commitments of previous plans and have the ability to 
quickly react to unexpected changes in the system. This paid off and our system 
outperformed other teams who relied on more stubborn agents,&amp;quot; explained 
František Zbořil Jr. The aim of the MAPC competition is to promote research and 
development in the field of multi-agent system programming. The solutions and 
results of this competition are then regularly published in scholarly journals.</description>

<title>19.3.2021 The faculty provided its students with equipment kits. It will help them with practical classes</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3040/</link>
<description>In the past weeks, the faculty prepared around eighty emergency packages 
which will enable students of follow-up Master's programmes to pass practical 
laboratory workshops even at home. The equipment kits will facilitate distance 
learning in the Design of Embedded Systems (NAV) and Principles and Principles 
and Design of IoT (TOI) courses. &amp;quot;We hope that this will at least partially 
compensate for the absence of students from laboratories where they would have 
had this equipment at their disposal. The packages contain a development kit 
and components for a total of six practice tasks for the NAV course. For the 
TOI course laboratory workshops, we provided the same development boards as in 
the NAV course package,&amp;quot; described Václav Šimek from the Department of Computer 
Systems, who prepared the student packages.</description>

<title>11.3.2021 The European SAUCE project involving FIT will provide smart content to help video content creators and game developers</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3036/</link>
<description>Can digital content be created in a smarter, better, faster and cheaper   
way? That was the main question for the European SAUCE project, in which the   
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/research/project/1194/.en&quot;&gt;BUT Faculty of Information Technology&lt;/a&gt; collaborated with four other universities   
and three industry partners - Disney Research, a part of The Walt Disney Company,   
DNeg - the maker of visual effects for many recent blockbuster films, and   
Foundry - the creator of one of the most popular TV and film post-production   
programs in the world.    
   
&lt;p&gt;The project has produced a number of innovative approaches based on research   
into lightfield technology. This technology will make it easier for the film   
and videogame industry to increase the efficiency of 3D content creation in the   
future, allowing the content to be reused and adapted to new conditions and   
user needs. FIT Researchers were involved in research into lightfield   
processing and its acceleration using state-of-the-art hardware. The project   
also included procedural animation and a system enabling video and game makers   
to perform semantic searches in huge collections of existing digital content. &lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;The researchers worked on the European &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sauceproject.eu/&quot;&gt;SAUCE&lt;/a&gt; project, funded under the   
European Horizon 2020 program, for three years. Some of the results are   
presented in a video available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB06O5Uzk5Q&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

<title>1.3.2021 FIT doctoral student looks for bugs causing apps to &quot;freeze&quot;</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3020/</link>
<description>Every day, we rely on the  
flawless functioning of dozens, if not hundreds, of applications and programs  
running on our computers, be they web browsers, information systems,  
communications software, or a multitude of hidden programs running in the  
background. We have come to expect applications not only not to crash suddenly,  
but also to respond very quickly to our commands. However, every user has  
experienced a situation where a new update to an important app caused it to  
slow down noticeably or even freeze up completely. This is exactly what Jiří  
Pavela, a doctoral student from the Faculty of Information Technology of Brno  
University of Technology, who is also one of the awardees in the Brno Ph.D.  
Talent competition, wants to prevent. You can read more in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/3019/.en&quot;&gt;the article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</description>

<title>10.2.2021 FIT students' apps: alcohol consumption and seating charts</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3010/</link>
<description>Applications that keep track of how many drinks you have had at the bar,    
find the nearest public toilet or help you draw random numbers. These are just    
some of the apps developed by students within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/course/TAMa/.en&quot;&gt;TAM course&lt;/a&gt; supervised by Adam    
Herout. Here are details about some of them:    
    
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.litcteam.leaveittochance&quot;&gt;Leave it to chance&lt;/a&gt; - an app that allows you to    
randomly draw items from a customised list, be it numbers, pictures or text&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.boozeplanner&quot;&gt;BoozePlanner &lt;/a&gt;- keep an eye on the amount of alcohol    
you drink at the bar and how much you pay for it. This app will also help you    
estimate your blood alcohol level&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fit.loolocator&quot;&gt;Loo Locator&lt;/a&gt; - the application includes a list of the

<title>3.2.2021 A DNS probe helps the CZ.NIC association with a more efficient collection of data</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3004/</link>
<description>The Accelerated Network Technologies Research Group (ANT@FIT) has been 
co-operating with the CZ.NIC association since 2018 on the creation of a probe 
for monitoring DNS traffic (DNS probe). Drawing on its experience with fast 
network traffic processing, the group helped develop a probe that can process 
DNS traffic very quickly using regular commodity hardware through the AF_PACKET 
interface or the DPDK system. In addition to receiving and processing packets, 
it was also necessary to find a solution for efficient implementation of the 
transaction table in the probe and to ensure easy configuration and export of 
the record in the new Compacted-DNS (C-DNS) format. The entire data collection 
system using monitoring probes was placed in the infrastructure of the CZ.NIC 
association, as stated on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.nic.cz/2021/02/01/efektivnejsi-sber-informaci-z-dns-serveru/&quot;&gt;CZ.NIC employee blog&lt;/a&gt; or on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lupa.cz/aktuality/cz-nic-zacal-sbirat-data-o-dns-pomoci-noveho-formatu/?fbclid=IwAR0ebgr_ujy6Aek_ZIKwLWPEl-GYcb9_zvMFAclvI_lZvoaiczWM-6BRUC4&quot;&gt;Lupa.cz &lt;/a&gt;server (in Czech). 
Thanks to the created probe, the number of reported transactions for the TCP 
protocol was increased by 5% to 10%.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our cooperation with the CZ.NIC association does not end with the DNS 
probe. We will continue to work together on the use of FPGA accelerator cards 
used to speed up and reduce the latency of responses to DNS queries. This 
project is still in its initial phase, but we believe that, over time, we will 
be able to reach the production deployment, as was the case with the DNS 
probe,&amp;quot; says Jan Kořenek, head researcher of the ANT@FIT group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

<title>2.2.2021 Researchers at FIT BUT in cooperation with Adobe Research developed a new augmented reality method and are waiting for their pat</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/3003/</link>
<description>Imagine yourself 
pulling out your phone to take a picture of a beautiful view. You point the 
camera towards the landscape and your device tells you, in augmented reality, 
the names of surrounding hills, their elevation, tourist paths in the area and 
can even show you the terrain contours. The new software tool created by 
researchers of the CPhoto@FIT BUT group is able to recognise the photographer's 
location and the photographed object and knows what the surrounding area looks 
like under different weather conditions. This allows you to edit the picture at 
home, e.g. make it sharper or adjust the shadows. On top of that, it can take 
you back to the place where the picture was taken using virtual reality. You can find more information &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/2996/.en&quot;&gt;in the article&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;</description>

task was to calculate the optimal descent trajectory for the Beresheet spacecraft's 
landing on the Moon and to design an environment for visualisation of descent 
trajectories. I managed to find the optimal descent trajectory which even 
counts with a reserve of fuel, and I also created an environment that provides 
users with simple and intuitive view of the descent trajectory. In addition, 
they can easily interfere with the visualisation,&amp;quot; describes Jakub 
Karpíšek.&amp;nbsp; 8 of BUT is a traditional 
presentation competition of the best Bachelor's theses wrote by students of all 
faculties of BUT in the last academic year. The winner of the 8th 
year of the competition is Michael Rosický, a student of the Faculty of 
Mechanical Engineering. For more information, go to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vutbr.cz/vut/aktuality-f19528/vitezem-souteze-8-z-vut-je-student-fsi-s-vyzkumem-ortopedickych-vlozek-d207924&quot;&gt;BUT website&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

<title>14.1.2021 Two FIT students received prizes in the Brno PhD Talent competition</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2991/</link>
<description>Among the 130 participating first-year doctoral students, two entrants 
from the Faculty of Information Technology impressed the jury of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jcmm.cz/stipendia-pro-nejlepsi-doktorandske-studenty-2&quot;&gt;Brno 
PhD Talent&lt;/a&gt;, a competition among Brno universities. Roman 
Andriushchenko and Jiří Pavela, both from the Department of Intelligent 
Systems, made it to the top-twenty-five and will thus receive a scholarship 
from the city of Brno. While Roman Andriushchenko focuses on computer-aided synthesis 
of probabilistic models, Jiří Pavela works on efficient techniques for 
measuring software performance. The competing projects and contestants 
themselves have been assessed by leading experts, primarily from abroad. The 
selected students will receive a financial aid of CZK 300,000 paid over the 
next three years. It should provide talented doctoral students with better 
conditions so that they can fully devote themselves to their studies and 
research.</description>

<title>18.12.2020 IT Spy:Thesis from FIT in TOP 10 of the Czech Republic and Slovakia</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2981/</link>
<description>The split 4th-10th place of the IT Spy competition 
went to Roman Andriushchenko from FIT. His diploma thesis, supervised by Milan 
Češka Jr., deals with computer-aided synthesis of probabilistic models. The 
work significantly increases the speed and accuracy of probability programs. 
These play a significant part in various areas of engineering and in fact 
represent the design of programs whose goal is to determine unknown parameters 
in order to achieve a given result. These programs can be used, for example, to 
design a communication protocol capable of transferring a specified amount of 
data, or to find optimal strategies for areas such as energy consumption 
management. The expert jury, made up of leading academics and business 
representatives, selected the best works out of over 1,400 diploma theses in 
the field of computer science from Czech and Slovak universities.</description>

<title>8.12.2020 FIT will co-operate on the development of the BringAuto autonomous vehicle</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2969/</link>
<description>The 
Faculty of Information Technology will co-operate on the development of an 
autonomous control system for the autonomous vehicle called &lt;a href=&quot;https://bringauto.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;BringAuto&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. 
Beginning next year, researchers from the Department of Computer Graphics and 
Multimedia will train deep neural networks and &amp;quot;teach&amp;quot; the vehicle to drive 
itself, as a part of the new project called H2020 5G-ERA. At this point, trial 
runs of the vehicle are being conducted in an Ostrava industrial site, where it 
collects chemical samples from individual production facilities and transports 
them to a laboratory. In future, it may also be used to deliver shipments, 
serve as a food truck or disinfect buildings. You can read more about 
autonomous vehicles in &lt;a href=&quot;https://forbes.cz/autonomni-rozvozy-uz-nejsou-sci-fi-a-pozadu-nezustali-ani-cesi/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Forbes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which mentions the co-operation with FIT as 
well; an article on BringAuto can be found online at &lt;a href=&quot;https://zvut.cz/napady-objevy/napady-a-objevy-f38103/80-procent-casu-stravi-kuryr-hledanim-vchodu-a-cekanim-resenim-rozvozu-baliku-jsou-podle-absolventu-vut-autonomni-auta-d205067&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;zVUT.cz&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</description>

<title>4.12.2020 FIT works together with Microsoft Research on protection against DoS attacks</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2966/</link>
<description>&lt;b&gt;Members of the VeriFIT group (Lenka Turoňová, Lukáš Holík, Ondřej  
Lengál, and Tomáš Vojnar) and their colleague Margus Veanes from Microsoft  
Research (Redmond, USA) found an innovative approach to protection against a  
class of DoS attacks. DoS attacks overwhelm the target service with such amount  
of traffic that it depletes its resources and makes the service unavailable for  
legitimate users. VeriFIT focuses primarily on ReDoS attacks, i.e. attacks  
against services using regular expressions.&lt;/b&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;Regular expressions are supported in all common programming languages.  
They allow searching for patterns, replace text and also validate user input.  
If a regular expression is used, for example, to look for patterns in network  
traffic (e.g. within an intrusion detection system (IDS)) or to validate user  
input to a network service, hackers can attack it and, for instance, shut down  
the target service or the intrusion detection system (and then do whatever they  
want on the network without running the risk of being detected).&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;First, the hacker tries to create an input string so that it takes a  
disproportionately long time to validate against the regular expression. If,  
for example, the login when creating a new user of a service is authenticated  
using the regular expression&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;/(([\-.]|[_]+)?([a-zA-Z0-9]+)){10,30}/&lt;/b&gt;, a ReDoS  
attack could be caused by the string &amp;quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;quot;. This is  
because validators based on backtracking and non-deterministic finite automata  
will search through all possibilities to split the input string into 10 to 30  
substrings before rejecting it. This type of attack shut down Stack Overflow  
for several days, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[img]&quot; src=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news-file/2966/regex.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;Validators based on deterministic finite automata do not suffer from  
this problem, but they have another issue: deterministic finite automata can be  
huge (e.g. the smallest deterministic automaton accepting the language of the  
regular expression&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;/[ab]*a[ab]{300}/&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;has more states than the estimated number  
of atoms in the observable universe). &lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;Developed as part of basic research into automata theory in  
collaboration between VeriFIT and Microsoft Research, the method can verify  
input efficiently using a newly introduced formal model called counting-set  
automaton. It is a special type of deterministic automaton, in which the  
configuration of the automaton contains the status and also certain counting  
sets, which can effectively represent limited repetition in regular expressions  
(e.g. the part with the number 300 in the expression&lt;b&gt;/[ab]*a[ab]{300}/&lt;/b&gt;). Thanks  
to these counting sets, a compact automaton can be created even for regular  
expressions that contain large repetition values, which can then be used for  
pattern searching or validation. For a certain class of regular expressions,  
this method provides a more robust pattern-searching algorithm than, for  
example, the well-known&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;b&gt;grep&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;tool or Google's optimised RE2 library.&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;This innovation by the VeriFIT group shows that the theory of finite  
automata, which was conceived 70 years ago and is often considered to be an  
unchanging fundamental pillar of theoretical computer science, is still subject  
to rapid developments with many practical applications. &lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;A video presentation by Lenka Turoňová, who was able to spend her summer  
at an internship in Microsoft thanks to the co-operation, is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bICOrgqkF40&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and  
the paper on the method is provided at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3428286&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[img]&quot; src=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news-file/2966/automat.png&quot;&gt;</description>

<title>13.11.2020 Computer stopped working a few days before submitting an assignment? Students may borrow faculty laptops</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2941/</link>
<description>What to do when your laptop breaks down before 
submitting an assignment and when there is currently no access to computer 
laboratories? Students who have to face such a problem can now borrow faculty 
laptops. &amp;quot;A student who gets into an awkward situation when, for example, they 
have no device they can use to work on their projects due to a malfunction, can 
ask the FIT library, which will provide a laptop in co-operation with the 
Computer Centre, as well as prepare a loan record. The student can then visit 
the library during opening hours to sign the record at the distribution point 
and pick up the laptop. The loan is intended for the necessary period before 
the student's computer is repaired, or before the student buys a new computer, 
so we expect they will have the laptop for a month at most,&amp;quot; explains Bohuslav 
Křena, Vice-Dean for Efficiency and Academic Affairs.&amp;nbsp;</description>

administration to meet and connect and thus create an open community that will 
help bring AI into the real world. On Wednesday, 11 November, the historically 
first meetup took place, during which the participants could learn about 
opportunities for new AI projects, practical examples of the use of artificial 
intelligence and successful research projects. Vítězslav Beran, Senior Lecturer 
and Vice-Dean of the faculty and one of the guests of this online event

<title>30.9.2020 First-year students in the Master's study programme will receive new Raspberry Pi microcomputers from FIT</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2903/</link>
<description>FIT 
will give out over two hundred small single-board Raspberry Pi 4 computers with 
small accessories to first-year FIT students enrolled in the Information 
Technology and Artificial Intelligence Master's study programme. &amp;quot;Students can 
use them in a number of courses and, in addition, in the current situation they 
can work on various school projects from home,&amp;quot; says Pavel Zemčík, Dean of the 
Faculty of Information Technology. However, the Raspberry Pi has a much wider 
use - students can, for example, connect small electronic devices to it, use it 
to play multimedia content, run office programs, browse the web or use it to 
automate their home. &amp;quot;We hope that with this new initiative, we will be able to 
pass on a positive attitude towards hardware and, in particular, an impulse 
that might kickstart other interesting projects,&amp;quot; adds Pavel Zemčík. Starting 
from 1 October, all new first-year students of the Master's study programme can 
collect the microcomputers at the Student Services Department during office 
hours.</description>

<title>29.9.2020 Algorithms developed at FIT help photographers. The new function can automatically straighten lines</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2902/</link>
<description>Zoner 
Photo Studio can now recognise lines in the photo and straighten the photo 
according to these lines thanks to a new feature developed at the Faculty of 
Information Technology. It will be especially useful for architecture 
photographers. &amp;quot;They often want the vertical lines to be actually vertical and 
the photo not to &amp;quot;fall&amp;quot;. The new feature detects lines that converge in the 
photo and automatically selects the appropriate ones for comparison. This makes 
it possible to correct the perspective of the image, but, at the same time, the 
software makes sure that the degree of deformation is not too significant,&amp;quot; 
explains Roman Juránek, the author of the library, which Zoner has newly 
integrated into its product. You can see how intelligent line straightening 
works &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCY5__Et-lM&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;in the video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;The 
solution is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/research/project/1263/.en&quot;&gt;TAČR (Technology Agency of the Czech Republic) project&lt;/a&gt;. 
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/research/group/graph/.en&quot;&gt;computer graphics research group&lt;/a&gt; has also developed a solution for 
anonymising faces and vehicle license plates and is working on smart noise 
reduction in photographs or horizon detection.</description>

<description>With effect&amp;nbsp;from September 23, 2020, the Regional Hygiene Station of the South Moravian Region prohibits the personal presence of students in classes. This measure applies to all universities in Brno, including the Brno University of Technology.

<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2888/</link>
<description>Due to the worsening situation regarding the spread of coronavirus, the BUT management decided to make changes in the organization of teaching. In an effort to protect the health of students and employees of the Brno University of Technology, therefore, part of the teaching will gradually move to the online courses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the second week onwards, which starts on September 28, the maximum of teaching will be moved online. This applies especially to large lectures, which can be adjusted to this form without major problems.&amp;nbsp;BUT faculties and departments will decide which of the training, seminars and laboratories must be kept in a day-time form, and these will take place in compliance with strict hygienic rules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the same time, please observe all points arising from the previous Rector's Regulation. We also draw attention to the&amp;nbsp;obligation to wear masks during classes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vutbr.cz/en/but/news-f19528/but-will-start-with-day-time-teaching-from-the-second-week-it-will-move-as-much-as-possible-to-online-teaching-d202597/decision-no-7-2020-on-the-organization-of-teaching-in-the-winter-semester-of-the-academic-year-2020-2021-at-but-p195101&quot;&gt;Decision no. 7/2020 on the Organization of Teaching in the Winter Semester of the Academic Year 2020/2021 at BUT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

<title>14.9.2020 Letter to students with information for the new semester</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2882/</link>
<description>&lt;br&gt;Dear students,&lt;br&gt;the beginning of the academic year is approaching and to this day we have promised you details about the form of study in the winter semester of the academic year 2020/2021, so we do so. It must be said that BUT will always follow the regulations or measures of the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Education. Therefore, if any new regulations from these institutions arrive in the coming days, we will inform you about them and these will always be strictly observed at BUT. We will also take into account the epidemiological situation in the Brno-City district, so that in the event of a worsening of the situation, changes in teaching may also occur. Unfortunately, this needs to be taken into account in this academic year. Below you will find a brief overview of the measures at BUT, but always follow the current information on the website of your faculty or department where you are studying, or in your information system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persons who have symptoms&amp;nbsp;of viral disease (e.g. fever, cough, shortness of breath, sudden loss of taste and smell, etc.)&amp;nbsp;are still prohibited to enter the BUT buildings. And it does not concern only covid-19, but any bad cold or other infectious diseases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As in the spring months, students are required to&amp;nbsp;electronically confirm a declaration on honour&amp;nbsp;in the information system that they do not have these symptoms on a daily basis before entering the BUT buildings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a student has any symptoms and is therefore unable to attend classes, he/she must immediately apologize from the classes (the specific form of apology is determined by the individual faculties and departments).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you have been directly imposed a quarantine or isolation in connection with covid-19,&amp;nbsp;inform the study department&amp;nbsp;of your faculty or department&amp;nbsp;immediately&amp;nbsp;so that we can take appropriate measures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If your health condition places you in the so-called&amp;nbsp;risk group, inform the study department of your faculty or department in the first week of the academic year and provide the appropriate doctor's certificate so that the necessary measures can be taken in time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If a situation arises that prevents the participation of a larger number of students while teaching (quarantine, extraordinary measures of the Ministry, teaching is led by an employee included in the so-called risk group, etc.),&amp;nbsp;teaching can be adequately adjusted or transferred to a distance form. This is always decided by the management of the faculty or the given department. Details can be found in the information system or on the website of your faculty or department.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In common areas, always keep&amp;nbsp;a distance of at least 2 meters&amp;nbsp;from other people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When entering the BUT buildings and after using the toilets, please&amp;nbsp;use the hand disinfection&amp;nbsp;available here. Remember the&amp;nbsp;obligation to wear a mask&amp;nbsp;in all indoor areas. In the teaching itself, follow the teachers' instructions regarding other hygienic measures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need to solve something in the study department, use telephone and e-mail communication primarily. E.g. Confirmation of study can be easily obtained electronically in the BUT IS. A personal visit is possible only after a prior telephone appointment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you are accommodated in the BUT halls of residence&amp;nbsp;and quarantine or isolation has been imposed on you, report it immediately to the email address&amp;nbsp;karantena@vutbr.cz. It is then forbidden to visit quarantined persons. Individual receptions then record all visits to BUT halls of residence. If you are coming from a country where there is a reporting obligation to RHS SMR, you must prove that you have fulfilled this obligation at the halls of residence reception. Masks are still mandatory in the Czech Republic in all indoor areas, i.e. also in halls of residence and canteens (except during the consumption of food). Please disinfect your hands when entering catering facilities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As is clear from this letter, this year's academic year will probably not be completely standard, however, our ambition is to keep full-time teaching as much as possible and allow you to successfully complete the beginning academic year. We believe that you understand and will follow the extraordinary measures, with regard to the health of yourself and your classmates and teachers. Our joint efforts depend on the personal responsibility of each of us. I firmly believe that you are aware of the seriousness of the situation. Our goal is definitely not to restrict you more than necessary. But these measures are needed so that we can manage everything together. Thank you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Petr Štěpánek&lt;br&gt;Rector of BUT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vutbr.cz/en/but/news-f19528/letter-to-students-with-information-for-the-new-semester-d202158/risk-factors-that-can-lead-to-a-very-serious-course-of-covid-19-even-the-death-of-patients-p194703&quot;&gt;Risk factors that can lead to a very serious course of COVID-19 even the death of patients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vutbr.cz/en/but/news-f19528/letter-to-students-with-information-for-the-new-semester-d202158/decision-no-6-2020-in-relation-to-the-development-of-the-crisis-situation-in-the-spread-of-covid-19-disease-caused-by-the-new-coronavirus-sars-cov-2-p194704&quot;&gt;Decision no. 6/2020 in Relation to the Development of the Crisis Situation in the Spread of COVID-19 Disease caused by the new Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2826/</link>
<description>The Ministry of the Interior has decided to present 
projects in the field of security research to the general public. Therefore, it 
published examples of implemented projects supported by the Ministry within the 
security research programme on its website. Examples of successfully 
implemented projects also include a new article on probes for analysis and 
filtering of traffic at the level of application protocols. The probes 
developed at FIT BUT will also be included in the brochure of the Ministry of 
the Interior, describing successful projects of the security research program, 
which is currently being created. You can read the whole article about probes 
&lt;a href=&quot;file:///C:/Users/necasovah/Downloads/Bezpecnostni_vyzkum_2015_2022.pdf&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; (in Czech only). The ANT@FIT research team is responsible for the project which helps the

<title>24.4.2020 Release of measures against the spread of coronavirus</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2771/</link>
<description>Individual  
consultations, practical training and practise at the university or university  
libraries are allowed since April 27 according to new government  
resolution. This applies to students of all grades, in groups of a maximum of  
five people. The personal presence of students in other forms of teaching and  
examinations is still prohibited.  
  
&lt;p&gt;The resolution allows access to the faculty to students of  
all grades under the same conditions as it was allowed to the final years students  
from Monday: Students can enter the faculty  
or other BUT building only if they have not a&amp;nbsp;quarantine measure ordered  
at the given time, they will have a&amp;nbsp;valid affidavit (in BUT IS) that they  
do not show signs of viral infectious diseases, will disinfect their hands at  
the entrance and will wear respiratory protective equipment all the time. For further  
information plese click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2770/.en&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;However,  
allowing individual study activities for students does not mean opening the  
faculty to all students. Students will be allowed a personal presence only  
after prior agreement with the teacher, the library, or after registering for the  
presence exam. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vutbr.cz/vut/aktuality-f19528/povoleni-individualnich-aktivit-spojenych-s-vyukou-na-vut-d198818&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.  
&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;At FIT, an  
individual consultations with teachers under the age of 45 are hereby permitted  
from 27 April 2020, by prior (e-mail or telephone) agreement. A&amp;nbsp;library  
is also available for all students, in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/units/library/library-news/2758/.en&quot;&gt;the same mode as for the  
students in the last year of study&lt;/a&gt;. We are  
also currently working intensively on the possibility of obtaining  
a&amp;nbsp;confirmation of study electronically.</description>

<title>24.4.2020 Information for applicants: The results of the school-leaving examinations for preferential admission can be submitted in June</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2769/</link>
<description>Applicants  
can now submit their results of the school-leaving examinations in mathematics or  
from the Matematika + exam, which can be used to enable preferential admission  
at FIT, later - 14 days before the enrolment deadlines, ie by 5 or 24 June. By  
this deadline, the study department must receive an application for  
preferential admission either in an e-application or by post. The faculty  
changed the date due to the postponement of school-leaving examinations at  
secondary schools.  
  
&lt;p&gt;The  
deadline for submitting an application for applicants who have met &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/info/smernice/sm2019-03d1-en.pdf&quot;&gt;other  
conditions for preferential admission&lt;/a&gt; (eg in the IQ test) is 31 May. Enrolments  
will be realized in distance mode on June 19 or July 8 (for further information  
please click &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2753/.en&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;).</description>

<title>17.4.2020 Information for applicants: SCIO tests are postponed, enrolments will be in distance mode</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2753/</link>
<description>SCIO  
postpones the dates of national comparative exams (the date from 1 May is  
postponed to 13 June, from 23 May to 27 June and from 13 June to 11 July).  
These dates are final and will not change. The tests will take place in the  
Czech Republic in person, in Slovakia, Russia, Ukraine or other countries online  
(if the situation in the Czech Republic does not allow it, they will be also online  
at the given date). In addition, SCIO has organized an extraordinary exam date at  
30 May, which will be online for the Czech Republic and Slovakia. FIT will accept  
the results of all dates. Applicants can choose the date of the exam paid by  
the faculty - it can be either 13 or 27 June.  
  
&lt;p&gt;Enrolments will  
be organized in distance mode within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/for-freshmen/.en&quot;&gt;set deadlines&lt;/a&gt;.  
Accepted applicants will receive a registration form from the faculty by post,  
which they will send back together with a certified copy of the graduation  
certificate. The study department will then enrol them for study in the next  
following enrolment date. It is therefore not necessary to apologize if you are  
unable to attend a certain enrolment deadline. However, the letter must be  
delivered by the deadline of enrolment. We would like to appeal to applicants  
not to postpone this due to possible problems with delivery by post or  
inconsistencies with documents.&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;Confirmation  
of study will be sent by the faculty to newly enrolled students by post  
immediately after the enrolment.&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2769/.en&quot;&gt;The results of the  
school-leaving examinations for preferential admission can be submitted in June&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>16.4.2020 The exam period is postponed, the final papers to be submitted two weeks later</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2752/</link>
<description>The academic year schedule is changing. Given the development   
of the the current situation, the FIT management has excluded &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/study/study-news/2719/.en&quot;&gt;Option 1&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; from   
the plans of the examination period and state final examinations. Therefore,   
the examination period is postponed by at least three weeks for all students   
and will not start before 25 May 2020. &amp;quot;The situation is constantly changing,   
so far we are counting on 'Option 2'. The examination period is formally   
extended to 30 September. That does not mean the exams will run throughout   
this period, but we have more room to set dates for exams, state final   
examinations and graduations according to previously published plans. By the   
end of April we will provide further information,&amp;quot; said Jaroslav Dytrych,   
Vice-Dean for Education in the Bachelor Study Program.   
   
&lt;p&gt;The deadlines for electronic submission of theses are   
also changing. The faculty management has set final deadlines, which are on May   
28 for bachelor thesis and June 3 for master thesis. &lt;/p&gt;   
   
&lt;p&gt;The faculty also prepares measures for the operation of   
the study department or library in the emergency mode when the relevant   
measures are released by BUT.</description>

<title>6.4.2020 New project of FIT BUT and FSS MUNI will provide feedback to psychotherapists</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2730/</link>
<description>Deep learning, automatic speech recognition technology, natural language 
computer processing and expert coding will help with feedback for 
psychotherapists. &amp;quot;Speech researchers&amp;quot; from the Speech@FIT group, together with 
researchers from the Department of Psychology of the Faculty of Social Studies 
of Masaryk University have received a grant from the Technology Agency of the 
Czech Republic for their project of machine analysis of therapeutic sessions 
recordings. &amp;quot;Psychotherapy requires continuous decision-making and constant 
evaluation of the course of the psychotherapeutic process by the 
psychotherapist. In practice, however, psychotherapists burdened by a lack of 
immediate feedback to support this decision-making process. The aim of the 
project is to create a software that will enable automated analysis of audio 
recordings from psychotherapeutic sessions and thus provide psychotherapists with 
feedback on the course of these sessions in a short time,&amp;quot; explains Pavel 
Matějka, leader of the project at FIT.</description>

<title>23.3.2020 BUT and Charles University belong to the prestigious network of European laboratories for AI</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2716/</link>
<description>Two Czech laboratories working in automatic speech and language processing have achieved significant international success. The results of the European program supporting the creation of artificial intelligence centers were announced in March, and the institutions involved in the HumanE-AI-Net project also include the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague and the Faculty of Information Technology, BUT. The HumanE-AI-Net project brings together leading European research centers, universities and industrial enterprises into a network of centers of excellence that goes beyond the narrow definition of artificial intelligence (hereinafter referred to as &amp;quot;AI&amp;quot;) and combines leading global AI laboratories with key players in related areas such as human-computer interaction science, cognitive science, social science, or the science of complexity. This is linked to a European strategy that focuses on human-centered artificial intelligence.

<title>10.3.2020 Safety measure of the Ministry of Health - situation at FIT</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2693/</link>
<description>Dear students,        
       
&lt;p&gt;due to today's       
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vutbr.cz/en/but/news-f19528/daytime-teaching-at-but-is-cancelled-from-march-11-2020-until-further-notice-d196408?aid_redir=1&quot;&gt;emergency measures of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic&lt;/a&gt;, we have       
been forced to cancel all the lectures, seminars, laboratory classes and       
consultations. These measures are valid from March 11, 2020 until       
further notice.&lt;/p&gt;       
       
&lt;p&gt;In the next       
few hours the guarantors or teachers will let you know about the planned       
measures for specific subjects, or how the lectures and seminars will be       
replaced in the next seven days (up to and including March 17). We expect that       
the measures will last at least for this period.&lt;/p&gt;       
       
&lt;p&gt;At the       
beginning of the next week you will learn more about the planned course of the       
semester.&lt;/p&gt;       
       
&lt;p&gt;There is no       
need to worry, it is certainly a priority for us to make everything go       
smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;       
       
&lt;p&gt;Please do       
not go to school unless absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;       
       
&lt;p&gt;CVT       
(Computer Centre), school libraries and sports facilities will be closed from       
tomorrow. The student club U Kachničky will also be closed. The FIT canteen and       
the FIT Study Department will be operating. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;       
       
&lt;p&gt;All the public events at the faculty are canceled or postponed indefinitely during this period.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students       
who are also employees of the faculty can attend the faculty due to their work       
duties if necessary. Postgraduate students may attend the       
faculty for the reason of replacing their full-time classes (for example, if       
there are webinars instead of exercises, they may organize them from the       
faculty premises) if necessary.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;       
If you have any questions, please       
contact your teachers, study advisors or vice-deans, but please use the means       
of mass communication first (courses forums, Facebook groups, Discord...)       
rather than individual questions.&lt;/p&gt;       
       
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your       
understanding and cooperation in managing this situation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaroslav Dytrych, Richard Růžička and Pavel Zemčík</description>

<title>12.2.2020 An algorithm that knows what film or book you would enjoy. A FIT student received a grant to design it</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2663/</link>
<description>Altogether eight projects received an award in the second round of the 
Soutěž podnikatelských nápadů &lt;i&gt;(Business 
Ideas Competition)&lt;/i&gt; launched by the South Moravian Innovation Centre last 
autumn. Petr Buchal, a student of FIT, was one of the successful presenters. He 
entered the competition with his project Discover Yourself which is based on a 
specific algorithm. It is designed to help people choose a book, a film, or a 
video game they will enjoy based on their choice of various preselected 
criteria. &amp;quot;I'm sure you know that feeling when you have just finished reading a 
book you liked and thought to yourself that you wouldn't mind reading a similar 
one. But you didn't really know where and how to look for it. Petr came up with 
an algorithm that uses data about what you usually read, watch, listen to and 
play and proposes a tailored solution,&amp;quot; describes Vojtěch Krmíček from South 
Moravian Innovation Centre who specialises in development of entrepreneurial 
creativity at schools. The young programmer estimates that the development of the 
application that uses the principles of machine learning will take about six 
months. The South Moravian Innovation Centre distributed a total of 430,000 
Czech crowns among successful students to help them develop their businesses.</description>

<title>10.2.2020 FIT ranked in the TOP 3 in Týden magazine&amp;#8217;s comparison of universities</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2659/</link>
<description>In the comparison of universities published by Týden magazine, Faculty 
of Information Technology ranked third (behind Faculty of Chemical Technology 
of UCT Prague and Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering of CTU) 
in the category Technical sciences.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;The comparison considered criteria such as interest in studies, quality 
of teaching and scientific personnel and SIR points that the faculty receives 
for specialised publications, articles, major grants and other scientific 
activities. &amp;quot;By publishing our own comparison, we do not mean to replace the 
national regulatory authorities. However, we would like to make the choice of 
university easier. Besides, our current students will certainly appreciate the 
information on the quality of their university. By publishing the comparisons 
of individual categories we would also like to appreciate universities that we 
consider true centres of education as we imagine the higher education 
institutions should be,&amp;quot; says Daniel Koppl, Executive Director of Empresa 
Media, the publisher of TÝDEN magazine.</description>

<title>20.12.2019 Happy New Year 2020</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2636/</link>
<description>Dear students, employees, graduates and friends of FIT,  
  
&lt;p&gt;This year - the year of its 120th anniversary - BUT received  
an institutional accreditation as the first technical university in the Czech  
Republic. It helped us innovate and obtain accreditation for the Bachelor's  
programme, as well as the Master's programme within which we launched 17 new  
specialisations. Furthermore, we introduced a Master's programme taught in  
English and accepted slightly more students in both the Bachelor's and Master's  
studies. It was a good year, in many other aspects too. In the following year,  
we would like to focus primarily on the quality of education, research and development  
and international co-operation, as well as the stability of conditions required  
for smooth operation of the faculty.&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank all those who have put their efforts to the work  
and studies at the faculty and wish you stability and happiness in the next  
year and merry and peaceful Christmas. &lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;Pavel Zemčík, Dean of FIT BUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;[img]&quot; src=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news-file/2636/e-pf_CZ.jpg&quot;&gt;</description>

<title>10.12.2019 Pavel Zemčík to keep the post of the Dean of FIT</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2621/</link>
<description>The Faculty of Information Technology will continue to be led by its  
current Dean Pavel Zemčík. It was decided on Tuesday by the members of the  
Academic Senate of FIT who elected him in a secret ballot by ten out of eleven  
votes. Pavel Zemčík, who was the only candidate in the election, served as the  
Dean of the FIT for the past four years.  
  
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;FIT is now a renowned, well-equipped and high-quality faculty. But the  
world is always moving forward. We must work intensively on the development of  
the faculty rather than only maintain its current condition. The task of the  
new management is likely to be different from the task of the current one as it  
will have to work in an environment that can change very quickly, especially  
when it comes to evaluation and financing of education,&amp;quot; considers Pavel  
Zemčík.&lt;/p&gt;  
  
&lt;p&gt;In his upcoming term of office 2020-2024, he plans to focus primarily on  
supporting the improvement of quality of research and education and promotion  
of sound economic conditions of the faculty's operation.&amp;nbsp;</description>

multiple disabilities,&amp;quot; said Radka Báčová from the FIT's Project Department.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;The department is planning to organise other events in the future, such 
as grant-funded consultations for students and researchers, series of lectures, 
internships for student or installation of a library box. &amp;quot;We welcome all those 
who have their own ideas on how to contribute to the social responsibility of 
Czech research, or would like to participate in it and do something for 
themselves, for their university and society,&amp;quot; Radka Báčová added. Those 
interested in co-operation can contact her by e-mail at bacova@fit.vutbr.cz.</description>

<title>1.12.2019 FIT presented its work on Interpol biometrics</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2614/</link>
<description>Methods of forensic work with fingerprints and face images created by 
the STRaDe research group in co-operation with the police of the South Moravian 
Region caught the attention of INTERPOL. Martin Drahanský, who is leading the 
group focusing on research and development of security technologies at FIT, 
presented these methods at the INTERPOL General Secretariat in Lyon. &amp;quot;Practical 
examples were based mainly on the work of Ondřej Kanich and Tomáš Goldmann. 
Both presentations had a wonderful response from the audience and we managed to 
establish contacts with a number of foreign police departments and forensic 
laboratories,&amp;quot; said Martin Drahanský.</description>

<description>An article titled &amp;quot;Chain-Free String Constraints&amp;quot; and its authors Lukáš 
Holík and Petr Janků from the VeriFIT research group won a prestigious Best 
Paper Award at the ATVA'2019 conference in Taipei. Their contribution

<title>8.11.2019 An award-winning application of a FIT graduate saves eyesight</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2589/</link>
<description>On Thursday, 7 November, an award ceremony of Atlas Copco and Edwards  
Awards took place at Atlas Copco's Sky Club. It was a great success for  
students of BUT. The Edwards Award rewards theses focusing on technical topics.  
This year, a total of 37 diploma theses applied for the recognition. Pavel  
Hřebíček, a FIT BUT graduate, whose Eye Check application caught some attention  
earlier this year at the Excel@FIT conference, won the second place. The  
application enables detection of an eye disease leukocoria. &amp;quot;Leukocoria is the  
whiteness of the pupil that may appear in a photograph taken with a flash.  
Early detection of this symptom can save the patient's eyesight,&amp;quot; explained  
Pavel Hřebíček, adding that his application works with a 98% accuracy. Learn

<title>30.10.2019 Prestigious ERC CZ grant for Lukáš Holík and the VeriFIT group</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2579/</link>
<description>How to make the automata technology more efficient so that the number of 
theoretically known application opportunities for finite-state machines can be 
realised in practice? The VeriFIT research group will look for new ways to 
achieve this goal as Lukáš Holík received a grant from the ERC CZ programme for 
the following five years. This national prestigious programme of support for 
research, experimental development and innovations provides funding for 
projects that were not supported at the European level due to insufficient 
funds within the European call. In the call, only seven projects were selected 
for the entire Czech Republic and the one selected for BUT is from the team at 
FIT. The project is concerned with research of technology for effective work 
with finite-state machines in applications such as verification and analysis of 
security of web applications and programmes handling data chains, programmes 
with indicator data structures, as well as in network operation inspection or 
in search for patterns.</description>

<title>18.10.2019 Following the modernisation of the AV technology in lecture halls and laboratories, the faculty is now fully digital</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2569/</link>
<description>From the beginning of the semester, all lecture halls, laboratories and 
conference and seminar rooms at the FIT are equipped with a new audio-visual 
technology - projectors, screens, signal components and cabling. The faculty 
thus completed the second stage of modernisation of the technology and 
equipment in teaching premises.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;The first stage of the modernisation took place last year, when almost 
all the AV technology in lecture halls was replaced. The modifications mostly 
concerned the lecture halls in building E, where the faculty also had the 
floors, teachers' desks and lighting replaced - the original lighting was 
replaced with more cost-effective LED lighting.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;This year, the AV technology was also replaced in the laboratories, 
conference and seminar rooms. &amp;quot;The modernisation of AV technology included 
primarily digitalisation of signal transmission and transition to Full HD 
resolution or higher, both in terms of projection and recording of lectures. 
Signals are transmitted between the devices either via HDMI or HDBaseT 
technology using classic UTP cabling, which is cheap, easy to install and 
durable; moreover, it was possible to use the existing cabling at some places. 
Sound is sent between lecture halls and technical rooms via the computer network 
using the Dante protocol,&amp;quot; explains Jana Skokanová from the FIT Computer 
Centre.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;Further changes are planned for the next year, in particular in lecture 
hall D where floors and furniture will be repaired and lighting replaced, just 
like in the other lecture halls.</description>

<description>A table on which a projector projects the user interface. A robot is 
attached on one side of the table and the worker sitting on the other side can 
control the robot using a touch layer on the table. That is one possible design 
of a robotic workplace of the future developed by researchers at FIT.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;In October, they also presented the mobile version of the ARCOR system 
at the International Engineering Fair in Brno. You could see this presentation 
as part of the CzechTourism exhibition in pavilion Z, stand No. 39.</description>

<description>Vojtěch Havlena, Lukáš Holík, Ondřej Lengál and Tomáš Vojnar of the 
VeriFIT group received the award for the best paper at the prestigious CADE 
2019 confe&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-29436-6_18&quot;&gt;rence dealing with the subject of automated verification in formal 
systems. The article titled &amp;quot;Automata Terms in a Lazy WSkS Decision Procedure&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; 
deals with decision-making on formulae for the WSkS logic using symbolic 
techniques for work with finite-state (tree) automata. The WSkS logic is used 
e.g. to describe infinite sets of charts in formal assessment and search for 
errors in programs with dynamic data structures. In addition, the Programme 
Committee awarded Vojtěch Havlena with the student Woody Bledsoe Award for an 
extraordinary contribution in the area of automated assessment.</description>

<title>23.9.2019 The faculty gave out almost two hundred microcomputers to first-year students in Master&amp;#8217;s study programmes</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2540/</link>
<description>The Faculty gave out almost two hundred small single-plate Raspberry Pi 
3B+ computers to first-year students enrolled in the new Master's programme 
Information Technology and Artificial Intelligence. Since this academic year, 
the programme has been offering seventeen new specialisations with curricula 
responding to the current trends and needs in the rapidly developing field of 
IT.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;The microcomputers were handed over to the first batch of students by 
the Faculty Dean Pavel Zemčík and his colleagues today at the introductory 
lecture of the AVS course (Architektury výpočetních systémů - &lt;i&gt;Computational Systems Architecture&lt;/i&gt;). 
&amp;quot;With this step, we want to motivate the students and provide them with an 
impulse to obtain a positive relationship, or even 'love' towards hardware,&amp;quot; 
said Pavel Zemčík.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi will enable students to work on school projects but its use 
is much broader - students can connect small electronic devices to it, they can 
create a multimedia video or music player, control camera surveillance systems, 
build a robot or automate their households.</description>

<title>5.9.2019 New Czech-Israeli research grant at FIT</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2525/</link>
<description>The objective of the new Czech-Israeli research co-operation is to find 
new methods for visual geo-location or estimation of depth from an image. The 
research grant was awarded to the team of Martin Čadík from FIT and the team of 
Professor Yosi Keller from Bar Ilan University. Together, the two teams will 
use the convolution neural networks to develop a new registration algorithm and 
descriptor of 2.5D and 3D models, a new method for localisation of cameras in 
the natural environment and a multimodal dataset for training networks 
predicting depth from a single image.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;If the researchers manage to develop these new methods, the results of 
the joint research could advance the development of computational photography 
and could also be of some use in medicine or security.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;The international project will last for three years. Its Czech part is 
financed by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic, 
the Israeli part by the Ministry of Science and Technology Israel.</description>

<title>3.9.2019 Faculty of Information Technology is launching a new website</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2519/</link>
<description>With the start of the new semester, the Faculty of Information 
Technology is launching a new website. The website is more responsive and 
adapts for better viewing on mobile phones and tablets; at the same time, its 
new structure reflects modern trends in the area of communication.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The new website aims to bring the faculty closer to the public - especially 
people interested in studying at the faculty and applicants, companies 
interested in establishing co-operation with the faculty, as well as to the 
general public, which can use the website to learn more about the research and 
development at FIT. At the same time, we focused on ensuring that the new 
structure provides easy orientation to the current students and that 
information is always easy to find and up-to-date,&amp;quot; said Vítězslav Beran, 
Vice-Dean for External Relations.&lt;/p&gt; 
 
&lt;p&gt;The design of the website is part of the unified visual communication of 
Brno University of Technology and is now used by all component parts of BUT. 
The faculty Computer Centre, the External Relations Department and other 
component parts of FIT participated in the creation of the new website of the 
Faculty. If you find any discrepancies on the new website, we would be very 
grateful if you could report them at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:web@fit.vut.cz&quot;&gt;web@fit.vut.cz&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

<title>1.7.2019 Summer school (F)IT for girls is taking place for the thirteenth time</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2492/</link>
<description>The participants of the Summer School (F)IT for girls had the 
opportunity to programme a LEGO robot, try hacking using a gummy bear, create 
their own chatbots or learn to edit photographs. Having the longest history in 
the Czech Republic, the event was organised for the thirteenth time this year 
in the period from 26 to 30 August 2019. It is intended primarily for students 
aged 12 to 19 who are interested in IT. With the &lt;i&gt;FIT fits girls (FIT sluší dívkám) &lt;/i&gt;project, the faculty strives to 
support young girls so that they do not fear the IT fields. For more 
information, go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://holky.fit.vutbr.cz/&quot;&gt;Summer School website&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

<title>28.6.2019 The Faculty of Information Technology has obtained accreditation for a new Bachelor&amp;#8217;s and Master&amp;#8217;s programme</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2493/</link>
<description>This week, the Internal Evaluation Board of BUT granted accreditation 
for a new Bachelor's and new Master's programme for the following 10 years. The 
most significant changes concern the follow-up Master's programme, which will 
offer 17 new specialisations reflecting the needs of the industry and enable 
graduates to better adapt to new trends (for more details, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/press/2416/.en&quot;&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;). The 
accreditation was granted as part of the internal approval processes that we 
could apply due to the institutional accreditation. The Brno University of 
Technology acquired the institutional accreditation in 2019 as the first 
technology-oriented higher education institution in the Czech Republic - the 
accreditation enables it to approve its own study programmes and thus better 
respond to educational needs and the needs of the labour market.</description>

<title>10.6.2019 Quantum Computing Workshop at FIT</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2464/</link>
<description>From 29 to 31 May, about twenty FIT students participated in the Quantum 
Computing Workshop. The three-day international workshop on quantum programming 
was organised by the Faculty of Information Technology together with the 
QLatvia research group of the University of Latvia. At the workshop, the 
participants were introduced to quantum calculations and learnt how to write 
simple quantum programmes. 
 
&lt;p&gt;The workshop was preceded by an opening lecture by Miroslav Iwachow, 
Technical Leader at IBM's industrial section for Central and Eastern Europe, 
who presented the first industrial initiative to build universal quantum 
computers for business and science. Abuzer Yakaryilmaz of the University of 
Latvia was in charge of the workshop itself; we also thank mentors Michal Bidl 
and Murali Karthick Baskar from FIT and Michal Sedlák from the Slovak Academy 
of Sciences.</description>

<title>25.5.2019 120 years of BUT at FIT: Open Day</title>
<link>https://www.fit.vut.cz/fit/news/2423/</link>
<description>On 25 May, BUT was celebrating its 120th anniversary and   
organised Open Days at all its faculties.   
   
&lt;p&gt;Visitors to the Open Day at the Faculty of Information Technology could   
see the faculty laboratories, which were accessible from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. For   
example, they could visit a biometric or robotic laboratory, see what it is   
like to be under a cyber-attack, try working with an interactive sand box or   
experience the way in which photographs can be viewed in virtual reality. The   
Museum of Computer Technology, which maps the development of computer technology   
with exhibits of memories from the first computers, was also opened and the   
visitors could likewise attend an exhibition of students' photographs. A   
lecture was held at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., describing how the faculty changed over   
the 55 years from the establishment of the Department of Automatic Computers   
and how it looked today. At 12 noon, visitors were taken for a tour of the   
faculty with one of the authors of the reconstruction, architect Aleš Burian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The celebrations of the 120th anniversary of BUT continued in  
the afternoon with a music festival held at the Pod Palackého vrchem campus.</description>
